## Password Generator

# Instructions

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge. 

You can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and all the numbers follow each other as well. 

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
